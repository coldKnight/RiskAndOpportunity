Risk and Opportunity: Managing Risk for Development
===================================================

The risk management played a very important part in the game as all decisions regarding allocation of resources had to take into consideration the probability of damage to meteors. This led to diversion of funds from development into insurance and protection. In some cases this proved to be a mistake as even though research showed a huge probablity of hit, the meteors missed. In such cases it appeared as if allocating huge amounts of resources towards insurance was proving to be ineffective. Therefore when I played the game for the next time, I immediately began by building structures in a small amount (around 3 to 4) but upgrading them whenever I had enough resources and there were no imminent threats. Also I would raise the level of protection by around 3 levels every time I developed or upgraded four structures. This paid off in the initial three stages. However soon I realized that meteors were hitting more frequently and with higher damages. So from 4th stage onwards I made sure that I had a level 3 insurance after one minute into the game. This greatly improved my recovery time as bigger and better structures recovered quickly and the development of the community was not nuch affected. Also high levels of protection from the start made sure that the damage was never more than 20%. 

Thus playing the game for the fourth time, I realized that as I was building more sturctures, it was not only neccessary to upgrade them quickly, but also to invest a significant amount of resources towards their protection (raising the land level). Further I made sure that I purchased level 3 insurance whenever I had enough resources and upgraded structures (of level 3 or more) as more advanced structures consumed more resources but they paid off in terms of higher development rate. Also I would make sure that in case of any hit, I linked at least 4 structures. This strategy paid off in level 4 when the island was hit by a meteor with a severity of the highest level (level 10) even though initial research showed a moderate probability of hit. The damage sustained was 22%, but since insurance paid 75% of the amount and I had linked 6 structures together in the time provided, I was able to quickly repair the structures and succeeded in proceeding to level 5 with less than 3 seconds to spare. This proves that with better planning and risk identification, we can not only absorb the impact of risks, but also make sure that the development of the society is not affected. Also those three seconds in real world can possibly save the lives of hundreds if not thousands of people during any disaster.

Coming to the question of change in the game, I would like to add one more risk of perhaps diminishing development rate or a disease oubreak if the structure are not upgraded or constructed for more than 30 seconds. This might better represent the real world in which there are not one but multiple risks to people especially in the developing world like more disease outbreaks or high inflation due to monsoon dependent agriculture. This might make the game more interesting and challenging to complete.
